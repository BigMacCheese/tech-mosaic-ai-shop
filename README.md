## Project info

**URL of the project**: https://tech-mosaic-ai-shop.lovable.app/

**Architecture**: The stack used in this project was entirely based on Lovable, that is why mostly of front-end and part of the back-end was created using Lovable prompts. Also, I used supabase for supporting the database and some other operations for innovating features using supabase edge functions. There are other technologies implemented to create the ai voice-assistant:
- **Gemini Live:** Used the gemini live API for creating the voice-voice interaction with the user and the ai.
- **Open AI:** For dinamically generating embeddings* of all the products stored in the database.

*The embeddings refering to the coordinates created for each product to create the RAG system for Gemini Live to use to give more accurate and context-aware answers to the user and to give recommendations based on the product they are looking at the moment.

**Approach:**
